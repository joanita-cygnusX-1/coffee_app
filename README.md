☕ Coffee App

A simple Python project designed to simulate a basic restaurant/coffee-ordering system. The goal of this project is to help me (the developer) build foundational backend skills using Python while following good software development practices such as pseudocode, user stories, documentation, and version control.

📌 Project Purpose

This project helps me learn how to think like a developer—breaking down a full application into smaller tasks using:

Pseudocode

CRUD thinking

User stories

Modular functions

Clean commits on GitHub

🧠 Features (Planned / Work in Progress)

Load and display menu

Accept user orders

Add items to cart

View and edit cart

Delete items

Calculate bill

Checkout

(Optional) Receipt printing

🧪 User Stories

Below is a simplified list.
As this project grows, I plan to move these to a separate file named USER_STORIES.md for better organization.

As a customer, I want to see the name of the restaurant so I know where I’m ordering from.

As a user, I want to view the menu so I can select items.

As a user, I want to choose items and specify quantities.

As a customer, I want to view and manage my cart (edit, delete).

As a user, I want to checkout securely and see my total.

As a customer, I want the option to print or skip the receipt.

🔧 How to Run the App
python coffee_app.py

🗂️ Pseudocode

The pseudocode for this project is stored in a separate file called:

coffee_pseudocode.txt

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add separate file for user stories (USER_STORIES.md)

Add proper error handling

Add dynamic menu loading from a JSON file

Add a database for persistent orders

Add receipt generation as a PDF

Add unit tests

Expand to a GUI (Tkinter or React + API)

Add an API backend version
