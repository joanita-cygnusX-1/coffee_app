git add -A gives error
fatal: Unable to create '/home/joanitapro8/coffee_app/.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.



Final checklist before logging out

git status → no uncommitted changes

git add + git commit -m "..." for any changes

git push → confirm up to date
